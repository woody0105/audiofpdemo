installation of dejavu:
 - psycopg2==2.8.3 installation issue 
	 error message:Error: pg_config executable not found.
	 Please add the directory containing pg_config to the PATH
	 
	 solution: sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

 - pyaudio installation issue
 	error message: fatal error: portaudio.h: No such file or directory
    compilation terminated.
    error: command 'x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc' failed with exit status 1

    solution: sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio

Storage Issue:
	62 music snippet of 30 second each produces 711382 fingerprints. Is there a way to kind of tradeoff between accuracy and storage/speed???


Test Result:
	already fingerprinted music is automatically skipped.

Storage Considerations:
	https://emysound.com/blog/open-source/2020/06/12/how-audio-fingerprinting-works.html#:~:text=From%20a%20higher%20level%2C%20all,possible%20with%20the%20smallest%20footprint.&text=We%20need%20at%20least%2040,10*sizeof(int)%20.

Parameter Tuning:
	parameters can be tuned to reduce the # of fingerprints per song at a cost of potentially compromised accuracy.

	Test:
		FINGERPRINT_REDUCTION: # of bits to grab from the SHA1 hash in the fp calculation

		PEAK_NEIGHBORHOOD_SIZE: # of cells around an amplitude peak, increasing the size by n times results in 1/n^2 of storage

	Test Result: 
		reducing FINGERPRINT_REDUCTION from 20 to 10, I got from 700k fingerprints to 200k fingerprints.
		increasing the PEAK_NEIGHBORHOOD_SIZE from 10 to 50 reduced it down further to 34k fingerprints.

Test Code Debug:
	subprocess code, change python to python3, multiple versions installed.

Issue:
    When building fingerprint db, '_mysql_connector.MySQLInterfaceError: Incorrect string value: '\xC4\xABve' for column 'artist' at row 1'
    solution:ALTER DATABASE dejavu CHARACTER SET = utf8mb4 COLLATE = utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
    		 ALTER TABLE dejavu.songs CONVERT TO CHARACTER SET utf8;

Issue:
	panic occurred: interface conversion: interface {} is nil, not []interface{}
	cause: path environment variable fails to reference proper ffmpeg or python3.
